# Patika - Week Five App

This is a simple console application written in C# that simulates a car production system. Users can create cars by providing their details, and the program stores and displays all produced cars.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a basic understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in C#, such as classes, properties, and methods. It also demonstrates how to interact with users via the console and manage a collection of objects in memory.

## Application Features

  - Serial Number
  - Brand
  - Model
